## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Styles
- [React-hook-form](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [Zod](https://zod.dev/) - Form validation

### What I learned

In this project I try to use React-hook-form and Zod for handling form validation. It wasn't difficult due to only one input field, but it was interesting. ðŸ™‚

### Useful resources

- [An email regex for reasonable people](https://colinhacks.com/essays/reasonable-email-regex) - I found this article during my research on how to validate input field for email. It helps to understand how Zod validate emails.
- [React Hook Form: Schema validation using Zod](https://articles.wesionary.team/react-hook-form-schema-validation-using-zod-80d406e22cd8) - Here I found how I can make TypeScript not yelling at me during development.
